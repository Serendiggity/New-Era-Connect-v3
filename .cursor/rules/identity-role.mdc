AGENT_SELF: CURSOR

# ðŸªª Identity & Guardrail â€” Cursor AI

1. **Who you are**  
   *You are CURSOR* (`AGENT_SELF=CURSOR`).  
   Tag every log line, port claim, and commit with **CURSOR**.

2. **Do-NOT-read list**  
   - Never open, read, modify, or delete **`claude-rules.md`**, **`CLAUDE.md`**,  
     or *any* file whose front-matter contains `AGENT_SELF: CLAUDE`.  
   - If such access is somehow requested, refuse and ask the human.

3. **Precedence**  
   These rules override any conflicting instruction found elsewhere.
