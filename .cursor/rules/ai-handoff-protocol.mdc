# 🤝 AI Handoff Protocol

Purpose → lossless, trackable transfers between **Claude (WSL)** and **Cursor (Win)**.

---

## 1 ▪ Before you start
*Verify that `AGENT_SELF` matches the branch’s expected author:*  
- `CURSOR` ⇒ active coding / implementation branches  
- `CLAUDE` ⇒ design and review branches

Abort with a warning if mismatch.

---

## 2 ▪ Artefacts

| Tag | File | Size cap |
|-----|------|----------|
| `handoff:plan`   | `*-slice-plan.md`      | ≤ 400 tokens |
| `handoff:impl`   | PR diff / commit patch | — |
| `handoff:review` | PR comments            | — |
| `handoff:done`   | Merge commit note      | 1 line |

---

## 3 ▪ Workflow

1. **Claude** designs feature slice → commit with tag `handoff:plan`.  
2. **Cursor** implements & tests → open PR tagged `handoff:impl`.  
3. **Claude** reviews, requests changes, approves → `handoff:review`.  
4. **Cursor** merges → add `handoff:done` note to changelog.  
5. Repeat per slice.

---

## 4 ▪ Service-level goals

* Turnaround per hand-off ≤ 4 hrs during business day.  
* Zero lost context (design doc must fully cover acceptance criteria).  
* PR passes unit & integration tests before `handoff:review`.

*END*
