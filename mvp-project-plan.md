### Project Structure
```

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ client/          # React frontend
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ server/          # Express backend
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ shared/          # Shared types
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ docs/           # Documentation
```

### Key Implementation Notes
- **Consistent Naming**: Use `status` field consistently across all entities
- **Activity Tracking**: Log all major actions using standardized action names
- **Timestamp Strategy**: Track processing milestones for analytics
- **Single-User**: Hard-code user_id = 1 in all database operations

## üö¶ Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **OCR Accuracy**: Mitigated by review queue for low-confidence results and proper status tracking
2. **AI Rate Limits**: Implement queuing and retry logic
3. **File Upload Size**: Set reasonable limits, compress images
4. **Data Consistency**: Use database constraints and proper status enums

### Schedule Risks
1. **Feature Creep**: Stick to MVP scope, document future features
2. **Integration Issues**: Test integrations early (Day 2)
3. **Deployment Surprises**: Deploy early and often

## üìà Success Metrics & Analytics

### Database-Driven Metrics
With the updated schema, track:
- **Contact Status Distribution**: Visual breakdown of processing pipeline
- **Processing Performance**: Average time from upload to completion
- **Review Queue Health**: Number of contacts pending review
- **Campaign Success**: Time from contact creation to email generation
- **Export Analytics**: Which campaigns are being used

### Week 1 Checkpoint
- [ ] Events can be created and viewed
- [ ] Business cards can be uploaded with proper status tracking
- [ ] OCR extracts basic information with confidence scoring

### Week 2 Checkpoint

- [ ] Dashboard shows meaningful analytics
- [ ] Deployed to production

### Post-Launch Metrics
- Number of cards processed by status
- OCR accuracy rate by confidence threshold
- Time from upload to email generation
- Export frequency and formats used
- User feedback on workflow
